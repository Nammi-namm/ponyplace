<h1>ponyplace is dead</h1>
<p>It has been fun, guys. Thanks for all the good moments.
<p><a href="http://phconline.net/" target=_blank>Lordcerii and Intet's PHC</a> is still around. You can go and play that. <p>Eventually our collaboration to create a new game something between PHC and ponyplace might be finished, but until then, I'm killing ponyplace.
<p>I hope you've enjoyed using ponyplace as much as I have enjoyed running it. These have been two great months.
